I am now a research assistant at <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University, Robotics Institutes</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/changliu-liu/" target="_blank">Changliu Liu</a> and <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/katia-sycara/" target="_blank">Katia Sycara</a>, working on multi-agent cooperative learning theory and human-robot interaction problems.

<br />
I received my Bachelor of Science from School Of Mathematics at <a href="http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/index.htm" target="_blank">Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou</a> in 2019.07, majoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. I earned the Best Bachelor Thesis Award.

<br />
Previously, I was a research intern working at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/" target="_blank">Microsoft Research Asia</a>, Machine Learning Group, and collaborated with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jiangbianhome/" target="_blank">Jiang Bian</a> and Jia Zhang. We built an end-to-end platform supporting various multi-agent scenarios and design a distributed reinforcement learning training system. Our platform will be open-sourced by Microsoft soon.

<br />
My research interests focus on, but not limited to Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Agent Interaction, Meta Learning, and Distributed Training System. I enjoy exploring theoretical understandings of sequential decision making problem and approaches to solve agent or robot interaction problem. I am also interested in machine learning system.

<br />

As a Ph.D. applicant this year, I'm looking forward to potential collaborations and positions. Feel free to contact me with E-mail if you have an interest in my research.
