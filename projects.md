Some of my projects in process are presented here.

### Reinforcement Learning
* **Multi-Agent Resource Optimization Platform**<br>
Collaborating: <b>Microsoft Research Asia</b><br>
MARO (Multi-Agent Resource Optimization) is an end-to-end platform for applied multi-agent reinforcement learning based on resource allocation optimization.
<br/>
MARO supports various graph-based multi-agent scenarios and offers popular deep RL algorithm implementations. The platform includes agents' information (state, action, reward) engineering, environment runner and user-defined business engine modules. MARO natively supports PyTorch.

* **Motivation Engineering in Graph-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**<br>
Collaborating: <b>University of California, Los Angeles</b><br>
In networked multi-agent reinforcement learning, we argue that individual reward engineering can motivate agents' cooperation.
<br />
Considering sequential resource allocation scenarios such as logistic network and routing, a variety of methods are proposed for motivation design in learning with graph feature processing. We introduce an attention mechanism to infer agents' individual action influence. For scalability of large networked multi-agent system, we design sub-graph layers and graph-layer attention to consider influence contagion.
<br />
Also, we now consider a method to calculate agents' contribution in cooperation task to improve cooperative performance. It is also a motivation engineering problem in MARL.
<br />
Our work papers will be published soon.

* **Policy Representation in Meta Reinforcement Learning**<br>
Collaborating: <b>Carnegie Mellon University</b><br>
Methods for representing networked agents' interaction in multi-agent system.
<br />
Considering a new agent as a new node in a multi-agent syetem, We plan to introduce an graph interaction representation for learning agent adaptation in a new environment.

* **Local Differential privacy in Decentralized Multi-Agent Learning**<br>
Collaborating: <b>Carnegie Mellon University</b><br>
Methods for privacy production in decentralized training, inspired from federared learning.
 
### Human Robot Interaction

* **ASIST: A Robust and Adaptive Agent that Supports High Performance Teams**<br>
Collaborating: <b>Carnegie Mellon University</b>, <b>DARPA</b><br>
State of the art in contour detection, hierarchical segmentation, and object proposals. Runs in 700 miliseconds on a GPU and a single CPU thread, thanks to a novel sparse representation of the segmentation results. From our ECCV 2016 paper.
