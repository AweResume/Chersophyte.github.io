Some of my projects in process are presented here.

### Reinforcement Learning
* **Multi-Agent Resource Optimization Platform**<br>
Collaborating: Microsoft Research Asia
State of the art in contour detection, hierarchical segmentation, and object proposals. Runs in 700 miliseconds on a GPU and a single CPU thread, thanks to a novel sparse representation of the segmentation results. From our ECCV 2016 paper.

* **Feedback Engineering in Graph-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**<br>
Collaborating: University of California, Los Angeles, Microsoft Research Asia
Method for producing segmented object proposals, state of the art pre deep learning. Given an image, it computes around 5000 proposals of segmented objects in less than 30 seconds on a single thread. From our CVPR 2014 and TPAMI 2016 papers.

* **Learning to Learn with Policy Representation**<br>
Collaborating: Carnegie Mellon University

 
### Human Robot Interaction

* **ASIST: A robust and adaptive agent that supports high performance teams**<br>
Collaborating: Carnegie Mellon University, DARPA
State of the art in contour detection, hierarchical segmentation, and object proposals. Runs in 700 miliseconds on a GPU and a single CPU thread, thanks to a novel sparse representation of the segmentation results. From our ECCV 2016 paper.
