It all started when my father taught me some notions of Visual Basic, and with the priceless help of the code completion tool (yeah, no Google at that time). Since then, I've been enjoying coding and here you can find some of the programs I've written.

### Reinforcement Learning
* **Convolutional Oriented Boundaries**<br>
State of the art in contour detection, hierarchical segmentation, and object proposals. Runs in 700 miliseconds on a GPU and a single CPU thread, thanks to a novel sparse representation of the segmentation results. From our ECCV 2016 paper.

* **Multiscale Combinatorial Grouping**<br>
Method for producing segmented object proposals, state of the art pre deep learning. Given an image, it computes around 5000 proposals of segmented objects in less than 30 seconds on a single thread. From our CVPR 2014 and TPAMI 2016 papers.
