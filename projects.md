Some of my projects in process are presented here.

### Reinforcement Learning
* **Multi-Agent Resource Optimization Platform**<br>
Collaborating: <b>Microsoft Research Asia</b><br>
MARO (Multi-Agent Resource Optimization) is an end-to-end platform for applied multi-agent reinforcement learning based on resource allocation optimization.
MARO supports various graph-based multi-agent scenarios and offers popular deep RL algorithm implementations. The platform includes agents' information (state, action, reward) engineering, environment runner and user-defined business engine modules. MARO natively supports PyTorch.

* **Motivation Engineering in Graph-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**<br>
Collaborating: <b>University of California, Los Angeles</b><br>
Methods for individual reward design and 

* **Policy Representation in Meta Reinforcement Learning**<br>
Collaborating: <b>Carnegie Mellon University</b><br>
Method for producing segmented object proposals, state of the art pre deep learning. Given an image, it computes around 5000 proposals of segmented objects in less than 30 seconds on a single thread. From our CVPR 2014 and TPAMI 2016 papers.

### Human Robot Interaction

* **ASIST: A Robust and Adaptive Agent that Supports High Performance Teams**<br>
Collaborating: <b>Carnegie Mellon University</b>, <b>DARPA</b><br>
State of the art in contour detection, hierarchical segmentation, and object proposals. Runs in 700 miliseconds on a GPU and a single CPU thread, thanks to a novel sparse representation of the segmentation results. From our ECCV 2016 paper.
