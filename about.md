As a physics Olympiad contestant in high school, I love astronomy and stargazing. I once shot the Great American Solar Eclipse of Aug. 21, 2017 in Atlanta.

I have been playing classical piano for 15 years and I got ABRSM performerâ€™s diploma in piano in 2012.

I also love playing the violin. I used to be the first violinist in the Symphony Orchestra of Sun Yat-sen University.

I am from Guangdong, China. Guangzhou is my favorite city.

Here are my graduation pictures in Sun Yat-sen University.
