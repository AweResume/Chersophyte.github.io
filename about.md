* As a physics Olympiad contestant in high school, I love astronomy and stargazing. I once shot the Great American Solar Eclipse of Aug. 21, 2017 in Atlanta.

* I have been playing classical piano for 15 years and I got <a href="https://us.abrsm.org/en/" target="_blank">ABRSM</a> performer’s diploma in piano in 2012.

* I also love playing the violin. I used to be the first violinist in the Symphony Orchestra of Sun Yat-sen University.

* I am very passionate about volunteer work. The campus public welfare bookstore I managed has helped thousands of poor Chinese children living in mountainous areas.

* I am from Guangdong, China. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou" target="_blank">Guangzhou</a> is my favorite city.

Here are my graduation pictures with my friend in Sun Yat-sen University.
